# BusyBus
BusyBus is an app that lets bus riders know of the next arriving buses at the Washington and State stop. 

**The Problem**  
Due to expansion, numerous bus routes have been recently added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Simply rushing to the stop when you see a bus coming no longer works because it might not be the bus the rider is expecting.  

 **The Solution**

I was responsible for user research including surveys, user stories, and a competitive analysis. I prototyped and wireframed my sketches and did several usability tests for the product. The final build came from a place of wanting to hit everything the users who took the survey wanted. A simple and clean interface, with not a lot of bells and whistles, accurate times and the possibility of a live GPS tracker. Combined with the problem that users were having at Washington and State stop, this final build solves that problem.
